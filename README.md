## 👀 Other features

- **Procedural Universe Creation**: Generate diverse galaxies with unique star systems, planetary bodies, and cosmic events.
- **Universe Simulation**: Simulate the creation and evolution of entire universes, complete with expanding galaxies and planetary motion in real time, following real time physics.
- **No Database or Pre-Saved Data**: _The Atlas_ does not rely on any database or predefined data. There is no storage of generated content (other than the cache). Everything is procedurally generated in real-time based purely on algorithms and a single primordial seed, even the images.
- **Procedural Nature of Existence**: The universe, galaxies, planets, and all their characteristics depend on the primal seed and how it is interpreted at the moment of generation. Given the procedural nature everything and nothing exists until we choose to observe it.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Fine-tune every aspect of the generation process, from physical constants to universe seeds, ensuring a personalized experience (editable via `pymodules/__constants.py`).
- **Synchronized Planet and System Rotation**: Planets and systems rotate coherently on screen, with synchronized yet differentiated rotation angles, ensuring visual consistency.
- **Procedural Planetary Ring Generation**: Planets can procedurally generate rings based on Roche limit calculations, with a realistic 5/7% chance of having rings.
- **Optimized Gradient Algorithm**: Automatically aligns the shading gradient with the planet's sun(s), dynamically adjusting transparency and opacity for realistic shadow effects.
- **Fully Synchronized Planetary Rotation**: Planetary rotation and orbital periods are fully synchronized, improving the dynamic accuracy of planetary motion and rendering.
- **Performance Improvements in Image Generation**: Enhanced Pillow-based drawing functions lead to faster rendering and better overall performance.
- **New Universe Initialization System**: Choose between exploring the default universe or creating your own custom universe using a seed-based initialization system.
- **Increased Planet Sizes and Detail**: Planet sizes have been increased by 200%, resulting in more detailed and visually consistent planetary images.
- **Dynamic Seasonal Changes**: Planets experience **seasons**, with temperature variations that depend on the planet's **orbital position** around its star. Temperature recalculations are performed dynamically as the planet moves closer or farther from its star using the **inverse square law of radiation**.

### 🔩 Configuration Made Simple

We've recently introduced the _Atlas Initialization Protocol_, a detailed onboarding process that guides you through configuring your universe on its first start. You can now choose between exploring the `Core Continuum` (the default shared universe) or creating your own unique universe via the `Design the Multiverse` option, which uses a seed-based initialization system.

**Stargate links** will only function properly within the `Core Continuum`. If you opt to create a custom universe using the `Design The Multiverse` feature, for stargates to work with others, both parties must have the same `cosmic_origin_time` and seed configured in their `atlas.ini` files. Without this, stargates won’t connect unless your Atlas server is publicly accessible on the internet.

Explore, experiment, and evolve with _The Atlas_—a universe where space and time converge in infinite possibilities.

## ⬜️ How Big is "The Atlas"?

In _The Atlas_, you can explore a universe of staggering proportions:

- **Galaxies**: Up to **1 sextillion** (10²¹) galaxies, each located within a vast 10-million-unit coordinate system.
- **Galaxy Types**:
  - **Dwarf Galaxies**: 100,000 to 10 million solar systems.
  - **Spiral Galaxies**: 1 billion to 50 billion solar systems.
  - **Elliptical Galaxies**: 10 billion to 100 billion solar systems.
- **Solar Systems**: Approximately **50 tredecillion** (5 × 10³¹) solar systems across all galaxies.
- **Planets**: Each solar system has 1 to 6 planets, resulting in an estimated **300 tredecillion** (3 × 10³²) planets.

These numbers showcase the incredible scale of _The Atlas_, where every exploration reveals new cosmic wonders within a nearly infinite cosmos.
