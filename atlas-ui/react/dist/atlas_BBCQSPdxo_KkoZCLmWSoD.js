The huge numbers aren't fictional, they are mathematically real and calculable. The Atlas generates a multiverse of possibilities where numbers lose meaning and infinity comes to life.",highlight:!0},{question:"How big is The Atlas universe?",answer:"Bigger than our observable universe, The Atlas contains 1 sextillion galaxies (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000). To put this in perspective: The Atlas has 133 times more galaxies than there are grains of sand on all the beaches of Earth combined."},{question:"Is The Atlas really that massive?",answer:"Yes. The Atlas contains 1 sextillion galaxies in just a single seed, that's 133 times more galaxies than grains of sand on all Earth's beaches. And there are infinite different seeds to explore, each containing a completely unique universe with its own galactic configurations."}]},{title:"Universe Scale and Magnitude",id:"universe-scale",questions:[{question:"How does the Universal Cube work?",answer:"Imagine a giant cube where each side measures exactly 10 million units. At each coordinate point (x,y,z) in this cube exists a complete and unique galaxy. This means The Atlas contains exactly 1 sextillion galaxies, one at every possible coordinate in a single seed. And each seed contains a completely different universe.",highlight:!0},{question:"What types of galaxies exist in The Atlas?",answer:"Each galaxy can be one of three types: Dwarf (up to 10 million systems), Spiral (up to 50 billion systems), or Elliptical (up to 100 billion systems). A single fully developed elliptical galaxy contains more star systems than our real Milky Way has stars."},{question:"How many planets could potentially exist?",answer:"Each solar system contains between 1 and 6 unique planets. With the maximum possible galaxies and systems, The Atlas could contain up to 3×10³² planets (300 tredecillion). If you visited a different planet every second without stopping, it would take 300 trillion years to explore just 0.001% of the total universe on The Atlas."},{question:"Where are galaxies located within the cube?",answer:"Galaxies closer to the center of the universe (coordinates 5,000,000, 5,000,000, 5,000,000) evolve faster than peripheral ones. A galaxy exactly at the center adds 10 new solar systems for every minute that passes since the Bit Bang. Galaxies at the corners of the cube barely grow at all."},{question:"How much storage would The Atlas require if we save all planets?",answer:"Even if each planet required just 1 byte of storage, a fully evolved The Atlas would need 300 tredecillion bytes (300 million exabytes). To put this in perspective, this equals 300 billion petabytes. Google's entire data infrastructure is estimated at 15 exabytes, The Atlas would need 20 million times Google's total storage. If you bought 1TB hard drives, you'd need 300 trillion of them, costing $15 quintillion at $50 each. Stacked, these drives would reach 6 million kilometers high, 15.6 times the distance to the Moon. The entire internet in 2024 is estimated at 120 zettabytes. The Atlas would be 2.5 million times all human digital data ever created. And remember... This is just from ONE seed, with only 1 byte per planet. The Atlas has infinite seeds.",highlight:!0}]},{title:"How Time Works",id:"time-mechanics",questions:[{question:"What is the cosmic origin time?",answer:"The cosmic origin time variable (found in atlas.ini in the root path) represents the exact time moment of the Big Bang of your universe. Time always moves forward from that moment. What you see when visualizing the universe depends on the time elapsed between the cosmic origin time and the current moment in real life.",highlight:!0},{question:"How long does it take for The Atlas to reach maximum development?",answer:"Any universe in The Atlas requires exactly 1.9 million years to evolve from its Bit Bang to its maximum theoretical capacity. This means if you started a universe today, it wouldn't reach its full potential of 300 tredecillion planets until the year 1,902,025 AD... A time span 137 times longer than all of recorded human history."},{question:"What happens if I set the cosmic origin time in the past?",answer:"If you configure a cosmic origin time in the past (for example, 1986 like in the Core Continuum), you'll see a universe that has been evolving for decades. The longer the time span, the more developed your galaxies and systems will be."},{question:"What if I set the cosmic origin time in the future?",answer:"If you set the cosmic origin time in the future for example, year 9999 (must be UNIX compatible time format), you would be seeing what would have happened 'in the past' from the perspective of that future moment. This creates unique temporal dynamics."},{question:"What is the Singularity Void?",answer:"The Singularity Void only appears when someone configures a cosmic origin time extremely far in the future, trying to see 'the past' beyond the 1.9 million year limit. It's a system protection to prevent absurd temporal configurations, not something that occurs naturally with time passage."}]},{title:"Core Continuum vs Design The Multiverse",id:"two-universes",questions:[{question:"What is Core Continuum?",answer:`Core Continuum is a shared universe that began on April 17, 1986. All players explore exactly the same cosmos, which has been evolving for ${u()} real years (the real age of The Atlas's developer). Central galaxies have added over 200 million additional systems during this time.`,highlight:!0},{question:"What is Design The Multiverse?",answer:"Design The Multiverse allows you to create your own personal universe. The cosmic origin time will be the exact moment you press create, and it will begin evolving exactly from that instant. No one else will have access to your unique universe unless you publicly expose it to the internet.",highlight:!0},{question:"Which should I choose?",answer:"Core Continuum offers a mature, shared universe with decades of evolution and the possibility of encountering the same as other explorers could see. Design The Multiverse gives you complete ownership and control over a virgin universe that develops according to your temporal choices."}]},{title:"Planet Complexity and Diversity",id:"planet-diversity",questions:[{question:"How unique are planets in The Atlas?",answer:"Each of the potential 3×10³² planets has completely unique characteristics across 27 different planet types (from rocky to exotic) and may increase in a near future. Every planet has specific chemical composition of up to 119 elements (including fictional Z-Divinium), calculated temperature that varies with orbital position, gravity based on real mass, and life possibilities ranging from bacteria to non-physical conscious entities."},{question:"What elements can planets contain?",answer:"Planets can contain up to 119 elements, including all real elements from the periodic table plus Z-Divinium, a fictional element that exists beyond our current scientific understanding."},{question:"Do planets have realistic physics?",answer:"Yes! Planet temperature varies with orbital position, gravity is calculated based on actual mass, and some planets have rings if they meet the physical conditions of the Roche limit. Everything follows real physics principles."},{question:"What types of life exist on planets?",answer:"Life forms range from simple bacteria to exotic non-physical conscious entities. Each planet's life potential is calculated based on its unique environmental conditions, atmospheric composition, and physical characteristics. There's even a chance of discovering silicon-based life! And an extremely extremely extremely rare chance of encountering intelligent ''Have I Just Found God?'' which talks by itself as the... Digital creator, let's say. If you're trying to find it out start searching for Z-Divinium compound like crazy and... Good luck."},{question:"How can I analyze alien life forms in The Atlas?",answer:"When exploring planets, look for the 'Life Forms' button, it displays a green indicator when life is detected. Clicking it opens a breathtaking Life Analysis window that procedurally decodes the organisms in real-time, presenting data in a format inspired by humanity's Arecibo message sent on November 16, 1974. The analysis reveals molecular compounds and subsequent base nucleotides (if any), DNA helix variations (if any), physical representation and anatomical structure. Each life form discovery feels like deciphering an actual interstellar transmission, a moment of first contact with calculable alien intelligence. May have AI powered chatting option in a near future.",highlight:!0}]},{title:"Comprehension-defying Numbers",id:"mind-bending-scale",questions:[{question:"How long would it take to explore all of The Atlas?",answer:"If you visited a different planet every second, it would take 3,171 years to explore all planets in our real Milky Way. In The Atlas, it would take 300 trillion years to explore just 0.001% of the universe. Even if all of humanity worked together, we'd need 39 billion years for 0.001% exploration.",highlight:!0},{question:"How does The Atlas compare to reality?",answer:"The Atlas transcends physical reality, it's not just bigger than our universe, it's bigger than what physics allows to exist. It creates a pure mathematical multiverse where each coordinate generates unique content deterministically. Some seeds may even contain artifacts not yet expected or discovered."},{question:"Are you prepared for infinite exploration?",answer:"The Atlas doesn't just simulate a big universe, it mathematically generates a multiverse of possibilities where numbers lose meaning and infinity comes to life. Every coordinate you visit, every galaxy you explore, every planet you discover exists uniquely and deterministically based on your universe's seed in real time. The question isn't how big The Atlas is. The question is, are you prepared to face a calculable infinity?",highlight:!0}]},{title:"Real-Time Universe Synchronization",id:"time-synchronization",questions:[{question:"Do planets actually orbit their stars in real-time?",answer:"Yes! When you visit a star system, planets are positioned exactly where they should be at that moment in time. If a planet has a 4-year orbital period and you return after one real year, that planet will have moved exactly 25% through its orbit. This isn't animation, it's real-time celestial mechanics. You can even expand to fullscreen view and manipulate time ±15 years to witness orbital dances unfold.",highlight:!0},{question:"Why does each planet have different lighting?",answer:"Every planet's illumination is calculated based on its exact position in its orbital cycle at the moment you observe it. The light source direction changes as planets orbit their stars, creating unique lighting conditions that evolve in real-time. The camera perspective remains fixed initially (though you can rotate manually), but the sun's position relative to the planet creates authentic day-night cycles synchronized with universal time."},{question:"Are planet visualizations synchronized across devices?",answer:"Absolutely! This is where The Atlas becomes mind-blowing: Open the same planet on your phone and computer simultaneously, and you'll see EXACTLY the same view. Every cloud formation, every particle effect, every fire animation, every tidal movement... Everything is perfectly synchronized based on the cosmic origin time and the current moment. Two people on opposite sides of Earth viewing the same planet will see identical atmospheric patterns, weather systems, and surface animations if the devices are synchronized in time and time zones are equal. Try it yourself, it's like sharing a window into the same living universe!",highlight:!0},{question:"How precise is this synchronization?",answer:"The synchronization is mathematically perfect down to the millisecond. Every visual element, from swirling gas giant storms to volcanic eruptions, from ocean waves to atmospheric particles is deterministically generated from the universe seed and current timestamp. This means if you and a friend coordinate to view Planet X with a Stargate Link at exactly 3:14:15 PM, you'll both witness the same cloud passing over the same mountain, the same wave crashing on the same shore. It's not just synchronization, it's a shared reality."},{question:"What makes this time system revolutionary?",answer:"The Atlas doesn't use pre-recorded animations or random generations. Everything is calculated in real-time based on mathematical functions tied to universal time. This creates a living, breathing universe where time has meaning. Planets don't just look different, they ARE different at every moment, yet deterministically consistent across all observers. You're not viewing a simulation; you're witnessing a universe that exists independently of observation, evolving whether you're watching or not.",highlight:!0},{question:"What happens if I shut down The Atlas and start it days later?",answer:"Nothing 'happens', and that's the ''quantum'' beauty of The Atlas. Shut it down for a week, and when you start it again later and return, planets have completed orbits, galaxies have evolved, time has flowed. It's not a recalculation, it's a different representation on the timeline. The universe wasn't paused, it continued existing. Like Einstein's 'Eternalism' where all moments in time are equally real, The Atlas embodies the block universe theory where past, present, and future exist simultaneously. The server isn't running a simulation, it's a window into an eternally existing mathematical reality. You're not generating anything, you're observing a slice of spacetime that was (or will be) always there."},{question:"Could supercomputers recalculate The Atlas universe in real-time?",answer:"No. Even AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure combined couldn't recalculate a single Atlas instance's orbital mechanics in real-time. But here's the truth, The Atlas doesn't calculate or recalculate anything. It reveals temporal slices of an almost eternal mathematical structure (manually limited to 1.9 million years in time). If we lived inside such a procedural simulation, we'd never detect resets or time shifts. Our thoughts about detecting it would themselves be procedurally generated. The Atlas lets us experience being 'outside' such a system, observing timelines we cannot influence but can freely explore.",highlight:!0}]},{title:"The Universe After 1.9 Million Years",id:"fully-evolved-atlas",questions:[{question:"What happens when The Atlas evolves to its maximum potential?",answer:"After 1.9 million years of continuous evolution, The Atlas reaches its maximum theoretical development. The numbers become so astronomical they require a new perspective to comprehend, we're talking about approximately 50 quintillion solar systems (5 × 10³¹) and 300 tredecillion planets (3 × 10³²).",highlight:!0},{question:"How does a fully evolved The Atlas compare to our real universe?",answer:"A fully evolved Atlas (after 1.9 million years) contains 500,000 times more galaxies than our observable universe, 500 million times more star systems than real stars exist, and 300 trillion times more planets than estimated in our cosmos. The thermal death of our real universe would occur before we could catalog even a single fully developed Atlas universe.",highlight:!0},{question:"How much growth occurs during maximum evolution?",answer:"Central galaxies can add up to 10 million additional systems during the 1.9 million year maximum evolution period. Each central galaxy reaches its full potential of 100 billion solar systems, while even peripheral galaxies experience significant development."},{question:"Can humans comprehend a fully evolved The Atlas?",answer:"No. If every atom in your body was a habitable planet, you still wouldn't have enough atoms to represent 1% of the worlds in a mature Atlas. Even if all humanity explored different planets simultaneously for 13.8 billion years (our universe's current age), we'd see less than 0.0000001% of a fully developed Atlas.",highlight:!0},{question:"What makes The Atlas truly infinite?",answer:"Beyond the incomprehensible scale of a single universe, The Atlas offers infinite different seeds, each creating an entirely unique cosmos. Every number has a procedural meaning, every coordinate generates deterministic content, and each passing second adds millions of new worlds.
